Terminal Loading Bar

This is built off of Ryan Young's Terminal Progress Bar project. I wanted to use C++ to make a loading/progress bar in the terminal that was as visually pleasing as possible with relatively simple tools.


Original Repository README:

This is a simple c++ application that will print a progress bar in a terminal for 
a specified period of time. 

There are a lot of things that make this only work under *nix terminals such as the ascii color
codes and the way I calcualte the terminal length. 

I like to use it as a visual timer.
